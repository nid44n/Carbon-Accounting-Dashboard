# Carbon-Accounting-Dashboard for ElectriCoal
GHG Accounting has been gaining popularity as it's crucial to decarbonization, and one of the most popular standards is the GHG Protocol. However, the calculations and Excel spreadsheets can be overwhelming and make it difficult for users to derive important insights from the data. Hence, creating a GHG Accounting Dashboard can be one way to uncover key insights.

Here, we see the summarized data for the reporting year of 2025. There are total emissions, along with emission intensities related to energy production (in tCO2e/MWh), fuel input (in tCO2e/GJ), and expenditure (in tCO2e/$). We also uncover GHG emissions by scope in a pie chart and the emission trend over time in a line graph, where users can adjust the period they want to observe.

Below that, there are breakdowns for each Scope 1, 2, and 3 under the GHG Protocol. For Scope 1, it shows emissions over the years from stationary sources, mobile sources, and fugitive emissions in a stacked bar chart. Scope 2 breaks down market-based and location-based emissions in another stacked bar chart. Scope 3 provides a pie chart and bars highlighting upstream and downstream emissions, uncovering different aspects such as supply chain and product use contributions.
